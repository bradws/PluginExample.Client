TODO:

1. COMPLETE How to wire-up the selection of the current tab item with MVVM ?

2. Start designing the text-to-filename algorithms.

3. Refresh button & checkbox to be synced correctly
4. COMPLETE Get rid of the parameter in DeletionMethod.GetFilenames(string s)

5. Look at Nunit testing & testrunner
6. Highlighting in TextBox possible?
7. Look at moving the TabItem into a seperate DLL as a seperate control.
8. SelectionMode=Single on the Tab Control ?

9.	Possibly change DeletionMethods to an observableDictionary? (with each plug-in containing a unique ID, and events from each pluch send up parameters (instead of the root window keeping a 'current index' ?))
		Need to look at the feasibility of this.

		10. Change RaisePropertyChanged event NOT to have strings. Also check the other related projects.
